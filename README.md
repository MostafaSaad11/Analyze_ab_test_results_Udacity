# Analyze A/B test
## Introduction
A company that is at a confusing!\
which created an alternative page for its products, and wants to decide which of the two pages is best the old one or the  new one.\
the matric here is converting rate.\
So I turned to a data analyst to help them understand what was going on behind the numbers.

## Technique
I make an A/B test analysis, where I used Python in more than one technique to understand the impact of that change on the company's growth and sales increase.\
I started with data cleaning and exploration\
then I started directly with hypothesis testing, and reinforced the result with a Z test, then I used the Logistic Regression technique to find the trends in the effect on purchase and conversion rate
